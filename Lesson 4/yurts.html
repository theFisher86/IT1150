			<dt>How are the yurts furnished?</dt>
			<dd>Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.</dd>

			<dt>What should I bring?</dt>
			<dd>Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure!</dd>
